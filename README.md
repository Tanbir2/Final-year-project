 **Abstract:** Recently, Bangladesh experiences heavy power cuts and a system loss (power transmission &
 distribution loss) of 11.11% in FY 2020-21. And, fault in the transmission line is one of the key reasons behind this.
 This paper proposed the CatBoost machine learning method for detecting electric power transmission line faults
 and classification. The prototype of the 2-bus power transmission system is developed in SIMULINK and the
 method of machine learning using CatBoost is developed in Python. The method is formed on the theory of the
 repeated combination of weaker classifiers based on the tree structure. The proposed method is adaptive towards
 balanced, imbalanced, and noisy data states. Also, the method achieves 99.87% accuracy in detection and on
 average 97% accuracy in the classification of line to line, line to line to line, line to line to ground, line to ground
 types of fault, and no fault. In addition, it also showed significant performance on the data obtained from standard
 IEEE 14 bus transmission network test case. Besides, the designed method eliminates the need for explicit pre-
 processing of categorical data, and is good performative towards various operating conditions (fault resistance,
 and distance) of the transmission system.
