**Background**  Recently, Bangladesh experiences heavy power cuts and a system loss (power transmission &
 distribution loss) of 11.11% in FY 2020-21. And, fault in the transmission line is one of the key reasons behind this.
 This work proposed the CatBoost machine learning method for detecting electric power transmission line faults
 and classification.

 **In short**  The prototype of the **2-bus power transmission system** is developed in **SIMULINK** and the method of machine learning using **CatBoost is implemented in Python**. 
 The method is formed on the theory of the repeated combination of weaker classifiers based on the tree structure. The proposed method is adaptive towards
 balanced, imbalanced, and noisy data states. Also, the method achieves **99.87% accuracy in detection** and on average **97% accuracy in the classification** of line to line,  line to line to line, line to line to ground, line to ground types of fault, and no fault. In addition, the designed method eliminates the need for explicit pre-processing of  categorical data, and is good performative towards various operating conditions (fault resistance,and distance) of the transmission system.
